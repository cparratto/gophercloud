/*
AuthOptions stores information needed to authenticate to an OpenStack cluster.
You can populate one manually, or use a provider's AuthOptionsFromEnv() function
to read relevant information from the standard environment variables. Pass one
to a provider's AuthenticatedClient function to authenticate and obtain a
ProviderClient representing an active session on that provider.

Its fields are the union of those recognized by each identity implementation and
provider.

	// IdentityEndpoint specifies the HTTP endpoint that is required to work with
	// the Identity API of the appropriate version. While it's ultimately needed by
	// all of the identity services, it will often be populated by a provider-level
	// function.
	IdentityEndpoint string

	// Username is required if using Identity V2 API. Consult with your provider's
	// control panel to discover your account's username. In Identity V3, either
	// UserID or a combination of Username and DomainID or DomainName are needed.

	// Exactly one of Password or APIKey is required for the Identity V2 and V3
	// APIs. Consult with your provider's control panel to discover your account's
	// preferred method of authentication.

	// At most one of DomainID and DomainName must be provided if using Username
	// with Identity V3. Otherwise, either are optional.
	DomainID, DomainName string

	// The TenantID and TenantName fields are optional for the Identity V2 API.

	// how these fields influence authentication.

	// AllowReauth should be set to true if you grant permission for Gophercloud to
	// cache your credentials in memory, and to allow Gophercloud to attempt to
	// re-authenticate automatically if/when your token expires.  If you set it to
	// false, it will not cache these settings, but re-authentication will not be
	// possible.  This setting defaults to false.
	//
	// NOTE: The reauth function will try to re-authenticate endlessly if left unchecked.
	// The way to limit the number of attempts is to provide a custom HTTP client to the provider client 
	// and provide a transport that implements the RoundTripper interface and stores the number of failed retries.
	// For an example of this, see here: https://github.com/rackspace/rack/blob/1.0.0/auth/clients.go#L311

  //This request behaves the same as a token request with no scope where the user has no
  //default project defined. If you do not make an explicit unscoped token request and
  //your role has a default project, the response might return a project- scoped token.
  //If a default project is not defined, a token is issued without an explicit scope of
  //authorization, which is the same as asking for an explicit unscoped token.
